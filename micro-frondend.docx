For most projects, the frontend world remains largely monolithic. Just as with the backend before micro-services, this means that it’s hard to scale development and that teams keep stepping on each other’s toes instead of being free to independently build, deliver, and choose their own tech solutions. Instead of working separately from each other, developers are all bound to the same codebase of a growing SPA or SSR app and so are all forced to crowd in the same build pipeline. This makes development inefficient and hard to scale.
